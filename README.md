# My First Git Project 

## Description
This is my very first repository created to learn Git and GitHub. I built this using C++ and managed version control via the command line.

## What I Learned
- How to install and configure Git
- How to use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`
- How to use `.gitignore` to keep my repo clean
- How to connect VS Code to GitHub
